Welcome to the **Infant Mortality Data Analysis** repository! This project focuses on exploring and analyzing data related to infant mortality rates, uncovering patterns, and generating insights to inform policy-making and healthcare strategies.

## Repository Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the steps involved in cleaning, exploring, visualizing, and analyzing infant mortality data. The analysis employs statistical and data visualization techniques to gain meaningful insights.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, data transformation, and ensuring dataset quality.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Summarizing key statistics and trends in the dataset.
- **Visualization:** Creating plots to highlight patterns and relationships in the data.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Applying statistical methods to draw conclusions about the data.
